Among people with Medicaid insurance in the United States, rates of severe
maternal morbidity – life-threatening complications during pregnancy, delivery
or after childbirth – range dramatically from about 80 cases for every 10,000
live births in Utah to more than 200 per 10,000 in the District of Columbia,
according to the study published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics &
Gynecology.
That means rates of severe complications were about 2.5 times higher in DC
than in Utah.
US maternal death rate rose sharply in 2021, CDC data shows, and experts
worry the problem is getting worse
“We expected some variation at the state level. We didn’t necessarily think it
was going to be a three-fold difference. So that was a pretty striking finding,”
said lead study author Dr. Lindsay Admon, an assistant professor of obstetrics
and gynecology at the University of Michigan Medical School and obstetriciangynecologist at U-M Health Von Voigtlander Women’s Hospital.
In the United States, attention is growing on maternal death rates and the fact
that the nation has the highest rate of mothers dying in pregnancy or childbirth
than other high-income countries. Just last month, data from the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that the rising US maternal death
rate climbed significantly yet again in 2021, reaching 32.9 deaths per 100,000
live births, up from 23.8 in 2020.
But maternal morbidity remains a public health issue too, Admon said.
“Maternal morbidity is 70 times more common than mortality,” she said. “These
are severe adverse events as well, and I think these are the first time we’ve
really had broad scale data at the state level about what the leading factors are
in individual states.”
